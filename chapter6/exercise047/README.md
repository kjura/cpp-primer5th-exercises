Exercise 6.47: Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in ยง 6.3.2 (p. 228) that
used recursion to print the contents of a ```vector``` to conditionally print information
about its execution. For example, you might print the size of the ```vector``` on each call.
Compile and run the program with debugging turned on and again with it turned off.
