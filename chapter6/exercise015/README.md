Exercise 6.15: Explain the rationale for the type of each of `find_charâ€™s`
parameters In particular, why is `s` a reference to `const` but `occurs` is a
plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the `char`
parameter `c` is not? What would happen if we made `s` a plain reference?
What if we made `occurs` a reference to `const`?
