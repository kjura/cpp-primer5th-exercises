Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments
and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal?
Explain why.
```c++
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
```
(a)
```c++
int ia[buf_size];
```
(b)
```c++
int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
```
(c)
```c++
 int ia[txt_size()];
```
(d)
```c++
 char st[11] = "fundamental";
```
