Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long,
and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and
a double?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Int's minimum size guaranteeded is 16 bits, long 32 bits, long long 64 bits, short 16 bits. A signed type represents negative or positive numbers including zero, whereas unsigned type represents values that are greater than or equal to zero. Float is a single precision type for holding numbers up to 6 digits after the decimal place, double is a double precision, up to 10 digits after the decimal place.
