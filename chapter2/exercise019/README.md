Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.<br />
<br />
`A pointer is a compound type that points to another type. Pointers are used for indirect access to other objects. A reference is NOT an object, whereas a pointer is an object in its own right. EVERY reference must be initalized at the time it is defined, a pointer need not be initalized. A pointer can be assigned to point ot a NULL value. references cannot be NULL.`
