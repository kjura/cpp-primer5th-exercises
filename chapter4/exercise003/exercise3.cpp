    No right or wrong answer. If we accept the the status of an undefined order of evaluation we definitely benefit
    from the fact that our programs can get speeded up. If we are talking about high-performance computing that is 
    an acceptable trade-off. On the other hand, if we want to program critical software (say, a control mechanism for
    a spaceship in space) this can unexpectedly blow up to our faces (it can literaly cost other people's lifes) so 
    it would be nice if the compiler could prevent such things from happening.


    Personally, I accept the trade-off, but with the example above, I would not opt for C++ if I had to create something
    safe and secure.
