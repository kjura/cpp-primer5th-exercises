# cpp-primer5th-exercises
My solutions to exercises from C++ Primer (5th Edition).


UPDATE to myself: 25.02.2023

Re-writing description of exercises takes just too much damn-precious time and when learning we should focus on doing things (programming) and not on mundane work. Starting from now only exercises explicitly marked as "write a program" will be put in repo. No descriptions going forward. Me Sorry :(
