# cpp-primer5th-exercises
My solutions to exercises from C++ Primer (5th Edition).


UPDATE to myself: 25.02.2023

Re-writing description of exercises takes just too much damn-precious time and when learning we should focus on doing things (programming) and not on mundane work. Starting from now only exercises explicitly marked as "write a program" will be put in repo. No descriptions going forward. Me Sorry :(

UPDATE to myself: 19.07.2023

aaaaaa, back again to writing things, I like it this way, way more productive for me


TODO (not only related to exercises but to the repo, automation etc.

- [ ] Create a bash that sets up files/dir for new stuff
- [ ] Document python build code
- [ ] Add CI for automated PRs from dev to master
- [ ] For practice, rewrite automation in C++ (long term goal, chapter 8 and then worth a shot?)
- [ ] Generate programatically a table with hyperlinks to exercises
