Exercise 8.11: The program in this section defined its `istringstream`
object inside the outer `while` loop. What changes would you need to make if
record were defined outside that loop? Rewrite the program, moving the
definition of `record` outside the `while`, and see whether you thought of all
the changes that are needed.
