Exercise 7.41: Rewrite your own version of the ```Sales_data``` class to use
delegating constructors. Add a statement to the body of each of the
constructors that prints a message whenever it is executed. Write
declarations to construct a ```Sales_data``` object in every way possible. Study
the output until you are certain you understand the order of execution among
delegating constructors.
