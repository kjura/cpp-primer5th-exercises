Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?

(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not
provide a default constructor.
(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated
type.
