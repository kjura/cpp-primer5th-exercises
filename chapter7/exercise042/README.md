Exercise 7.42: For the class you wrote for exercise 7.40 in ยง 7.5.1 (p. 291),
decide whether any of the constructors might use delegation. If so, write the
delegating constructor(s) for your class. If not, look at the list of abstractions
and choose one that you think would use a delegating constructor. Write the
class definition for that abstraction.
