Exercise 7.37: Using the version of ```Sales_data``` from this section, determine which
constructor is used to initialize each of the following variables and list the values of the
data members in each object:


```cpp
Sales_data first_item(cin);
int main() {
    Sales_data next;
    Sales_data last("9-999-99999-9");
}
```
